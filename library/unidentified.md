### Community-based Modeling Forum in Support of Integrated Water Prediction
- DOI: -
- TYPE: Panelist
- EVENT: 
- CITATION: NOAA’s National Ocean Service (NOS) will host a town hall to discuss the development of a community-based modeling approach to support the burgeoning NOAA Water Initiative and NOAA’s unified modeling framework.  The NOAA Water Initiative is working towards establishing boundary-spanning partnerships across multiple sectors to create and deliver integrated or ”total” water information to meet the needs around inland and coastal water issues. A unified modeling approach will facilitate the transition of new models and upgrades by laying out the framework and standards for model coupling in order to streamline the process of sharing data sets and model code.  NOS intends to discuss its model requirements and gather feedback on ways to improve service delivery through this unified modeling effort, and better leverage the external research community to accelerate the transition of regional coastal research models into NOAA. Opportunities to foster collaboration with coastal modelers and practitioners through cloud computing and grant initiatives like the Coastal Ocean Modeling Testbed will be discussed.
